- **Minimum Confidence**: Reliability threshold for association rules (0.1-1.0)  
- **Minimum Lift**: Strength threshold for meaningful associations (1.0-5.0)

### Performance Settings
The application includes optimized settings in `.streamlit/config.toml`:
- WebSocket compression for faster data transfer
- Increased message size limits for large datasets
- Optimized file watching and caching

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**No Association Rules Found**
- Lower the support threshold (try 0.01-0.03)
- Reduce confidence requirement (try 0.3-0.5)
- Ensure you have sufficient borrowing data

**Slow Performance**
- The first run processes and caches data (may take 30-60 seconds)
- Subsequent interactions are nearly instantaneous
- Consider reducing dataset size if memory issues occur

**Empty Insights Tab**
- Check data quality and completeness
- Ensure required columns are present
- Fallback basic insights will display if auto-generation fails

**Upload Errors**
- Verify CSV file format and required columns
- Check for special characters in file names
- Ensure files are not corrupted or empty

**Caching Errors**
- Clear Streamlit cache: `streamlit cache clear` or restart the app
- Check for sufficient disk space for cache storage
- Ensure data files haven't changed during processing

**Theme Detection Issues**
- The app automatically adapts to light/dark themes
- If UI elements appear incorrectly, refresh the page
- Theme changes may require a full page reload

### Data Quality Tips
- Remove or handle missing values in key columns
- Ensure timestamp formats are consistent
- Verify book_id values match between datasets
- Use the validation helper script to check data quality
